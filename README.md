# test_task

```docker-compose up``` will bring up 2 images: 
  * mysql containing table hn.hackernews, user/pass: root/pass
  * php script test.php, figure out yourself what it's doing

Task 1: add to the compose YAML new image (use already existing images as much as possible) - nagios available on localhost on port 81. Make it monitor the mysql each 5 seconds, it should check SHOW PROCESSLIST and if it sees any query running longer than 5 seconds it should trigger CRITICAL alert. Commit your changes and make a merge request.

Task 2: fix the performance issue in test.php / mysql config (find the problem yourself). The point is that the mysql query now takes about 30 sec while it should take a second or less. Commit your changes and make a merge request.

Task 3: add to the compose YAML another image running Manticore Search. Make it index all from hn.hackernews from the mysql on start and start searchd. Commit and make a MR

Task 4: add to the compose YAML another image running php + some web server running on port 82. The php script should be search.php and should be able to do search.php?query=something, go to the searchd, find documents by the query, then go to the mysql, fetch the documents and return that all
